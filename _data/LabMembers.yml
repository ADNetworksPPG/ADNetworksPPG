  description: 'Yadong Huang and his team focus on the causes and progression of Alzheimer''s disease. Specifically, they study a variant of apolipoprotein
  E, called apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4). Approximately 60â€“75 percent of Alzheimer''s patients carry the apoE4 variant, making it the most important genetic
  risk factor for Alzheimer''s disease. The team uses mouse models and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells made from skin cells of patients carrying apoE4
  or other mutations related to Alzheimer''s disease to study their effects on the development, survival, and degeneration of neurons. In addition, Huang''s
  lab is working to identify drug targets and develop therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer''s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.'

  description: 'Jorge Palop''s lab aims to understand the neural processes underlying cognitive decline in Alzheimer''s disease and neurological conditions,
  such as epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. His team focuses on a type of neuron that stabilizes neuronal networks in the brain, called inhibitory
  interneurons, and the role they may play in the cognitive dysfunction and abnormal patterns of neuronal network activity that accompany Alzheimer''s
  disease. Ultimately, Palop''s group aims to define the mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction at the molecular, circuit, and network level, as well as to
  develop novel therapeutic approaches to restore brain functions in Alzheimer''s disease.'

  description: 'The Mucke lab focuses on how major neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer''s disease and autism spectrum disorders,
  cause cognitive deficits, behavioral abnormalities, and other disabling symptoms. They study people afflicted by these conditions, as well as related
  mouse and cell culture models, to unravel disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic strategies. The group''s ultimate goal is to advance the
  understanding of devastating brain disorders to a point where transformative treatments can be developed for their prevention, control, and reversal.'

  description: 'Ryan Corces studies the contributions of genetic and non-genetic factors to neurodegenerative diseases. While genetic mutations modify
  genes directly, non-genetic factors, such as previous illnesses, exposure to environmental chemicals, or aging, can leave lasting imprints on the epigenome,
  the DNA sequences and associated proteins that control gene activation. Using computational biology, large-scale screens, and single-cell technologies,
  the Corces Lab probes the epigenome of cells derived from patients, with the aim to understand how it impacts disease risk and to develop novel avenues for
  therapeutic interventions.'

  description: 'Katie Pollard and her team develop statistical and computational methods to compare genomes and use the differences to decode how genomes
  work. Their analyses of massive sets of genomic and epigenomic data include investigating human genetic variation, understanding what makes humans unique
  compared to other species, and characterizing the genomic diversity of the human microbiome, the group of bacteria that populate our digestive system and
  other body sites. This evolutionary focus, coupled with rigorous statistical methods and bioinformatics tool development, gives the lab a unique
  perspective on human health and disease.'

  description: 'Dr. Pico''s research focuses on understanding the complex networks that make up biological systems. New technologies continue to drive
  the amount and diversity of data types that can be analyzed via network analysis. Dr. Pico develops software tools and resources that help analyze,
  visualize and explore biomedical data in the context of these networks. Dr. Pico is the Executive Director for the National Resource for Network
  Biology (NRNB) and leads the Systems Biology Group for Gladstone Bioinformatics as Associate Director. After obtaining a PhD in molecular neurobiology
  and biophysics from Rockefeller University in 2003, Dr. Pico joined Gladstone as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Gladstone Senior
  Investigator Bruce R. Conklin, MD, where he focused on bioinformatics and software development. He went on to conceive of and co-found WikiPathways,
  as well as coordinate and contribute to a variety of scientific research tools, including GenMAPP-CS and Cytoscape.'

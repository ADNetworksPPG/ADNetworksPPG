  description: 'ArchR is a full-featured R package for processing and analyzing single-cell ATAC-seq data and integrating this with single-cell RNA-seq data.
  ArchR provides the most extensive suite of scATAC-seq analysis tools of any software available. Additionally,
  ArchR excels in both speed and resource usage, making it possible to analyze 1 million cells in 8 hours on a MacBook Pro laptop.
  ArchR is currently in beta. You can find everything you need on our [website](https://www.archrproject.com/)
  or in the [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.066498v1).'

  description: 'Data from our 2020 publication on human brain scATAC-seq, HiChIP, and bulk ATAC-seq is publicly available through
  [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147672). This data comes from cognitively healthy individuals. We have also set up a
  WashU Epigenome Browser [track hub of cell type-specific chromatin accessibility](http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/legacy/?genome=hg38&session=drS3o1n4kJ).'
